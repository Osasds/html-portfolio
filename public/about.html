<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Osas Solomon, and I am excited to share a bit about myself and my journey into the world of web development with you.</p>

<p>I am a budding web developer with a strong passion for creating functional and visually appealing websites. Although I am relatively new to the field, I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am continuously expanding my skills and knowledge in web development.</p>

<p>My interest in web development began during my college years, where I studied Zoology. and due to the limited opportunities in the field the necessity to broaden my knowledge was a must. I was fascinated by how websites are built and how they function, so I took the initiative to learn coding on my own through online courses and tutorials.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working on building my portfolio and taking on freelance projects to gain hands-on experience. My work involves using HTML  to develop a project portfolio.</p>
